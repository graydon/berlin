This is the directory where perl demo stuff for Berlin goes.

Requirements:
  1) threaded perl
     This is needed for CORBA callbacks to work right -- the boa has to run
     in a separate thread.  On debian potato, just
       apt-get install perl-5.005-thread
     and you should be fine.
  2) perl modules (read the bottom of this document before installing these,
     or you'll just have to do it over again):
    2a) COPE
        This is the CORBA library that we use; see
          http://www.lunatech.com/research/corba/cope/
        for more details.  You'll need to get the Experimental::Exception
        module as well, which is distributed from the same FTP directory.
        For COPE itself, I use the CVS version, though 0.6 might work as
        well.  0.5 will take major tweaking.
        COPE itself requires an interface repository to work; the standard
        one is included in ORBacus and called irserv, or there's a contrib
        program in the COPE tree (COPE/compat/MICO/*) to let you use MICO's
        interface repository instead.
        (on debian, I just did:
           cd compat/MICO
           apt-get install mico-2.3.0-dev
           g++ -o irior.cc -o irior -lmico-2.3.0 -ldl
           cp irserv irior ~/bin
         ~/bin is where store misc little programs like this, but you can
         put the programs anywhere in your path.)
    2b) Unicode::Map8, Unicode::String
        We need these for text support in Berlin.  Get them from your
        favorite CPAN mirror.

  All of the perl modules _must_ be compiled and installed by the threaded
  perl, not the normal perl, or they won't work.
  This isn't too hard -- just go to the module build directory, and where
  you would normally do
    perl Makefile.PL; make; make install
  you instead do
    perl-thread Makefile.PL; make; make install
  and things should be linked correctly and go to the right places.

Once you have all the requirements installed, just start the server, and do
  make; ./demo.pl
and look at the pretty, alpha-rendered, picture.
