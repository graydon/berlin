# This file defines common variables for the entire source tree.
# It requires the variable $(top) to be set to the path of Berlin's
# root directory in the including Makefile.
#
# ALL Makefiles should include this file near the beginning, because a lot
# of variables are initialized here. After that, the variables CPPFLAGS and
# DEPFLAGS should only be appended to.
