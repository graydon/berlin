This is a trouble-shooting guide to getting the Berlin display system
up and running.



1) Building
===========

1-1) The 'configure' script can't find my CORBA environment, it says:

|  configure: error: No supported CORBA environment found!
|  configure: error: /usr/src/Berlin/./config/Warsaw/configure failed for config/Warsaw

You may not have configured your ORB environment properly.  Remember
that you need to fully install your ORB application.  In the case of
omniORB, this includes properly building omniORB and omniORBpy,
running the ORB name server and having the ORB bin directory in your
path for programs such as omniidl.



2) Installation
===============

(No installation instructions yet.)



3) Running
==========

3-1) When starting up the server it spits out errors finding shared libraries:

|  server: error while loading shared libraries: libWarsaw.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

You need to add the $berlin-build lib directory to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.  With sh/bash/zsh do it like
this ($berlin-build is your Berlin build directory, see the INSTALL
file for more info):

  $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$berlin-build/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

And for csh/tcsh:

  % setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $berlin-build/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

----------------------------------------------------------------

3-2) When starting up the server I get:

|  unable to open IDL:Warsaw/DrawingKit:1.0 with attribute implementation=LibArtDrawingKit

Are you running the Berlin server from the right build directory?
Also check the berlinrc config file you're supplying for the server.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3-3) I get errors about NameService like:

|  Cannot get initial reference for NameService:

Run the omniORB nameserver, see the omniORB docs for more information.

----------------------------------------------------------------

3-4) When I running the Berlin demo client, text isn't displayed, on
     buttons or next to the checkboxes.

Try specifying which default font the server is to use by setting the
environment variable 'BERLIN_FONT_CHOOSER' to the empty string and
reruning the server.  On startup, it should present you with a list of
fonts to choose from on the console from where you started up the
server.
