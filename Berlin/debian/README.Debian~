berlin for Debian
----------------------

PLEASE NOTE: This is a pre-alpha release of Berlin. At this point, nobody's
even taken the time to tie up loose ends in the CVS tree and announce a new
stable branch. However, this is generally considered a next generation
berlin server (in comparison to the last 'stable'), so it's been given a new
verion number: 0.1.0. Please, instead of calling it by this number, call it
simply 'berlin from today's development branch' -- things are liable to
change before 0.1.0 is actually released.

  Note that Berlin is steadily gaining functionality (text and image display
recently) but there is still no unification layer for these. In addition, the
plugin organization is still somewhat ad-hoc, implying that network
interoperability machanisms are still somewhat unrefined.

  Currently, there are only three demos for berlin: 'button', 'draggable'
and 'terminal,' the latter of which doesn't work, but is still included in
this distribution. Each of these is wrapped to conserve namespace, and in
addition so some plugins that would have unnecessarily hogged namespace
could be moved out. To call any of these, append the prefix 'berlin-' to
their names: berlin-button, berlin-draggable, and berlin-terminal. The
server itself is wrapped as well in the script 'berlin.'

  Please do not, after witnessing the simplicity of the demos, their
lagginess, and the server's tendency to crash, discount Berlin as still in
infantile development stages. On the contrary, the display server is
currently much more capable than the demos suggest; all that's needed is
more manpower to publicize these capabilities with working client code.
The same goes for its speed. Optimization has barely been pursued at all
at this point, and much is possible DESPITE our use of CORBA as the
communication protocol (contrary to the beliefs of some).

To help with the Berlin project and push towards solving both of these
dilemmas, please have a look at http://www.berlin-consortium.org or join the
mailing list (design@berlin-consortium.org). To subscribe, send a single
mail to design-request@berlin-consortium.org with the word 'subscribe' in
the body of the message.

  This server requires omniNames to be running and correctly configured
before it will work. Before you run the clients, you need to run the server
(of course!).
 
  Because Berlin's only currently working display engine is written with
OpenGL using GGI as a target, the display server can be displayed in almost
any environment; however, it's STRONGLY recommended that you refrain from
anything but X. Anything else you do at your own risk -- I can tell you from
experience that you may have to do a hard reboot to get out.

If you have any questions, feel free to drop me a line.
