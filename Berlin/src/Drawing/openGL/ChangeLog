	* Pointer.cc ("C"): fixed a bug which was causing overwrites of the
 	linear framebuffer. Now it checks boundaries of the buffer.

	* GLPencil.cc (GLPencil): modified pencil to accept style values,
 	and added in new drawing routines based on style values. Still
 	pretty feature-thin, but it does polys and rectangles with RGBA
 	now, which is enough to play with. it's more than X, anyway :)

	* Pointer.cc : Redid the pointer so that it looks like an X
	pointer rather than a blob of colors, and fixed a buglet
	in the directbuffer write loop (write()) which was causing
	the screen update to skip lines, giving a somewhat cool 
	but ultimately broken looking "scanline" effect.

	* GLDrawable.cc: hoisted in some code from the old DBGraphic for
 	initializing GL properly.
