Raster is an interface to the W3C PNG specifications.
As such, it should allow transparent access to all
PNG information.

* allow to specify (PNGEncoder) how to encode a Raster
* allow access to individual chunks
* make sure pixel access works for arbitrary storing
  formats (as specified within the png structures)
