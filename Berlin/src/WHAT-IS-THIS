This directory currently contains 2 *separate* implementations of the berlin
class libraries. This is an unfortunate side effect of the fact that we're 
in the middle of a rewrite and still porting some bits and pieces. It's easy
to tell apart though -- the new stuff is all in the UpperCase directories, 
and the old stuff is in lowercase. Simple. We'll be adding in more roadmaps
as time goes on, so keep your pants on.
