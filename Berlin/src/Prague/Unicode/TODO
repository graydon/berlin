- Documentation! Lots of it :-)
- Removing all those FIXMEs that are scattered through the code
- Improving Unistring support (at the moment only storage of
  Unicode Strings works. None of the unicode-functions is
  implemented yet).
- Improving Unichar support. Most functions work allready.
- Adding locale-support. I need that for sorting.
- Fixing bugs.
