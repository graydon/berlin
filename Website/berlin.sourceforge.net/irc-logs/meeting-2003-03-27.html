[14:27:31] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: hmm, should we start ?<br />
[14:27:40] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: yeah, looks like about time.<br />
[14:27:49] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: njs says he'll show up in about one half hour from now.<br />
[14:28:02] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: ok, fine.<br />
[14:28:37] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Alright! First on the agenda!<br />
[14:28:43] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> who thinks he will work on fresco in the near future ?<br />
[14:29:12] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> ook. That's a toughie. :)<br />
[14:29:28] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> ooh, meeting<br />
[14:29:33] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: heh. Well, we should align the goals for M3 with that. Doesn't look good. :/<br />
[14:30:00] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> I am planning to wipe up the FontKit because it's a total mess. But besides that, I have exams followed directly by a full day long job for summer.<br />
[14:30:20] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: ouch<br />
[14:30:22] <i> * <font color="brown">hunger</font> wants to get those redraw bugs fixed. </i><br />
[14:30:35] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> Even though I'm going mad over the whole exercise:-)<br />
[14:30:45] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: ok, beside the FontKit stuff, are there other things you'd like to work on ? What about the Path stuff ?<br />
[14:30:46] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Yeah. The "crap on the screen" bugs are amazingly annoying. They shouldn't be there.<br />
[14:30:59] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: Oh, I'd like to. :)<br />
[14:31:08] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: I'd like the coordinate system rejiggered, too.<br />
[14:31:16] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: actually, I think the Path stuff could be the single most important feature in the short term future.<br />
[14:31:27] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: ??<br />
[14:31:39] <i> * <font color="green">stefan</font> goes to grab a coffee </i><br />
[14:31:56] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: the coordinate system? You remember that the WidgetKit is oversized, then the Consoles are running in 24dpi to make up for it? That's gotta change.<br />
[14:32:21] <i> * <font color="brown">hunger</font> agrees. </i><br />
[14:32:34] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: yeah. I found a couple problems with the Viewport Demo, but there's still a lot of stuff (find bugs filed by kentyman).<br />
[14:33:27] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> The thing with the coordinate system is that we don't need to fix it now, since it looks just fine. But I don't want to accrue even more bad code. It must be fixed before we ask for client authors to start work.<br />
[14:36:03] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: oh, yeah, getting the global CS right is a serious bug.<br />
[14:36:31] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: ok. I'll bump the priority on Paths so I do them before FontKit work.<br />
[14:37:29] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: but rendering/picking errors are nasty. I don't understand why we have so many...<br />
[14:38:00] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> blame libart ;)<br />
[14:38:14] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: It's probably just a few bugs appearing all over the place.<br />
[14:38:26] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: Hopefully.<br />
[14:39:38] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: One thing with picking, I don't believe we transform the coordinates before delivering them? Or something like that, due to dragging. Kentyman has a bug for scrollbars misbehaving when y-rotated... I'd like to fix it, but the system needs documentation.<br />
[14:40:28] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Tell that to stefan:-) I'm only trying to figure out what he was doing and wether there might have been a bug somewhere.<br />
[14:41:53] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: right, the event handling needs to be thought over, especially the CS of the positional events.<br />
[14:42:42] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: there are some issues, notably when you drag a window, i.e. the transformation from the global CS to the local one changes *while* the events are handled.<br />
[14:43:12] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: ah, documentation should be a high priority task.<br />
[14:43:18] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: well, I question whether that should be happening; the CS the events should be translated to shouldn't be that of the window, but of the desktop.<br />
[14:43:19] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: we should work on the tutorial.<br />
[14:43:31] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: I was thinking of something a little closer to javadoc.<br />
[14:43:38] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> doxygen?<br />
[14:43:50] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: I got a nice pdf generated, only need to upload the necessary infrastructure to purcel so the pdfs can be generated there, too (in the nightly build)<br />
[14:43:54] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> well, the tool itself doesn't matter. It would probably be synopsis.<br />
[14:43:59] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: ok<br />
[14:44:05] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: what do you mean ?<br />
[14:44:18] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: what kind of document do you have in mind ?<br />
[14:44:20] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: a reference manual, not simply a tutorial.<br />
[14:44:27] <font color="maroon">njs`</font> has joined #fresco<br />
[14:44:29] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: 'not simply a tutorial' ?<br />
[14:44:33] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: hello!<br />
[14:44:39] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Something like the refmanuals?<br />
[14:44:43] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> hi njs`<br />
[14:44:46] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: writing a tutorial is a thousand times more difficult (for me at least) than generating a ref manual.<br />
[14:44:52] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: ...and much more useful, too.<br />
[14:44:55] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Do you wish to improve those or write something new?<br />
[14:45:01] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: probably, yes.<br />
[14:45:03] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Well.<br />
[14:45:35] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: picking for example can't be understood just by looking at the ref manuals. A tutorial has to explain the whole context.<br />
[14:45:48] <i> * <font color="maroon">njs`</font> ssh's to the host "njs" is logged in from to read logs </i><br />
[14:45:54] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: I agree, the tutorial is necessary.<br />
[14:45:55] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: and in fact the current tutorial does a bit of it. It's far from complete, I admit.<br />
[14:46:15] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: hi there<br />
[14:46:56] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: but so are particulars, like exactly which object does what, and how internal pieces work. A refmanual for the DesktopKit that explains how it does things like move windows. Stuff like that. <br />
[14:46:57] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: What's the status of SXR? Is chalky on it?<br />
[14:47:00] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: so, if for example you design a new path API, I'd suggest that you write a chapter on that in the tutorial *in parallel*<br />
[14:47:12] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: that's a very good plan!<br />
[14:47:24] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: yes, agreed. But for a start I believe it's better to get the big picture than to start with the details.<br />
[14:47:39] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: oh. Well, when bughunting, I need details. :-)<br />
[14:47:42] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> or write the tutorial first :-)<br />
[14:48:02] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: no. I should really get off my butt and finish sxr.<br />
[14:48:19] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: So should I:-)<br />
[14:49:01] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> ok, so we have identified a couple of tasks: the path stuff, work on the tutorial, more work on the website (sxr !)<br />
[14:49:14] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: I have some time at my hand, but somehow I allways manage to find something less productive to do then sitting down and work on fresco.<br />
[14:49:17] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Coordinate system and UI bugs.<br />
[14:49:24] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: do you have some time to spend on the unit tests ?<br />
[14:49:33] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: yeah, the usual stuff...:-)<br />
[14:49:44] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: how can I build unit tests for the FontKit? I need a running server, don't I?<br />
[14:50:04] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: of course, I *want* to work on event handling and focus management. But I have been saying that for a long time...:-/<br />
[14:50:27] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: I've been counting on you to work on it. :-)<br />
[14:50:30] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> stefan: not to get sidetracked, but now that gcc's new C++ parser has landed, are you thinking of stealing it?  (since it seems from what little I've seen that half the SXR work is fixing bugs in openc++)<br />
[14:51:23] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: may be. Is it LGPL ? Or, even better, does gcc provide access to the parse tree (or even the syntax tree) ?<br />
[14:51:54] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> gcc doesn't actually build a full AST does it? Or was that the old parser?<br />
[14:52:02] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> stefan: talk to zwol.  I'd guess it's GPL, though.<br />
[14:52:15] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: part of the problem was that the old gcc didn't allow to hook into it, because they feared the GPL could be circumvented <br />
[14:52:58] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> stefan: nod.  you could always rip it out of the source tree, I suppose :-)<br />
[14:52:59] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: hmm, well, I think GPL isn't even the issue. But anyways, that's offtopic...:)<br />
[14:53:32] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: openC++ works well enough for me, I don't think I'd touch it any time soon.<br />
[14:53:50] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> re: my time: I seem to have way overcommitted on school/research stuff for the next months, so I don't know if I'll have much if any time for Fresco :-(<br />
[14:54:07] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: oh well<br />
[14:54:10] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hm.<br />
[14:54:29] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> sorry guys :-(<br />
[14:54:35] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> I guess what we could do, is have a lightweight release in three months, then something more serious than that for M4?<br />
[14:54:45] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: we should discuss the path stuff in a different meeting. Outline what is needed, what issues need to be addressed (such as unwinding, tesselation, etc.)<br />
[14:54:52] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> "M3: the largely dormant period?"<br />
[14:55:10] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> "M3: thinly sliced banana"<br />
[14:55:18] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: well, I honestly believe a tight release schedule of 3-4 months is important.<br />
[14:55:28] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: all right.<br />
[14:55:35] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> what do others think about that ? Is 4 months enough for a release ? Is it 'too often' ?<br />
[14:55:48] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: I can't see us getting too much done in the timeframe.<br />
[14:55:57] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: if you can write code that figures out whether the fontkit works, then you can have unit tests for it.<br />
[14:56:06] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: I don't really care.<br />
[14:56:19] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> stefan: I agree on the importance.<br />
[14:56:35] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Having no releases is bad, having releases without any user-visible changes is not much better though.<br />
[14:56:38] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: does it matter?  it's not like you'll get more done if you put off the release farther.<br />
[14:56:41] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: well, I can test most of it I guess. I mean, it won't tell me if the data is correct, but ...<br />
[14:56:47] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: well, if a given task doesn't fit into such a scheme, split it up. That's a good idea anyways, just to measure the progress. That's what milestones are all abuot anyways.<br />
[14:56:51] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: no, but the later the release, the more there is in it. :)<br />
[14:57:14] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: I don't care about users or what they think right now.<br />
[14:57:35] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: the point is to keep *us* on track, and provide some measures to see how or whether we progress.<br />
[14:57:37] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Users == fellow developers too.<br />
[14:57:42] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Right. We're still pre-users at the moment.<br />
[14:57:51] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> But some people do clamour for screenshots...<br />
[14:57:57] <i> * <font color="red">scanline</font> agrees with hunger's comment </i><br />
[14:58:21] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: well, that doesn't change anything. I don't make milestones because I want to show anybody 'outside' that we are making progress. It's a measure for *insiders*.<br />
[14:58:34] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: that aren't very many these days, I admit. But well, that's life.<br />
[14:58:38] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: It's a PR issue... not important to what we do, but important to how other poeple think about fresco.<br />
[14:58:42] <font color="gray">zwol</font> has quit (Remote closed the connection)<br />
[14:58:52] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: sorry, I couldn't care less about PR.<br />
[14:58:52] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> stefan: getting "outsiders" interested is the only way to get more defelopers. Mindshare does matter<br />
[14:58:54] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> If it takes a year to get visible changes, then it takes a year to get visible changes; the release schedule won't effect that.  So the question is, is it better or worse to make extra releases without them...<br />
[14:58:55] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> err, developers<br />
[14:59:21] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> stefan: you can "piggyback" on gcc. but that requires patching it<br />
[14:59:29] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> I don't think that developers (that would be useful to us) care only about neat themes when they look to see if progress is being made :-)<br />
[14:59:38] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> the developers are somewhat resistant to making the parse tree available easily<br />
[14:59:44] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> njs: Agreed. The releasecycle has little influence on what we do anyway.<br />
[14:59:49] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: exactly. And I think that extra releases don't matter to anybody. Who noted that M2 was done anyways ? Those who contributed did, (almost) nobody else. That's fine !<br />
[14:59:51] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Exactly. We need to build core feature set. Hence things like Paths and Fonts.<br />
[14:59:55] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> njs`: well, there's that... but at the moment, it's not obvious there's any progress at all based on the web site<br />
[14:59:58] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> because some of them think that proprietary software will then steal the parser.<br />
[15:00:01] <font color="slategray">plfiorini</font> has joined #fresco<br />
[15:00:21] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> stefan: well, yes, that's largely because we suck and never announced it anywhere :-)<br />
[15:00:34] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> however, pretty themes and such that would interest the average person are more likely to get fresco mentioned to developers that would be useful<br />
[15:00:41] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Indeed. We should've posted it to fresco-announce for God's sake! That's what it's there for~!<br />
[15:00:45] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: I don't agree. Knowing that a release is due in about three weeks does create some pressure to finish things.<br />
[15:00:49] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: at least for me.<br />
[15:01:20] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Hmmm... that's a argument.<br />
[15:01:28] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: that's *the* argument.<br />
[15:01:33] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> :-)<br />
[15:01:43] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: well, not the pressure, but the need to align things, prioritize tasks, etc.<br />
[15:02:02] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: that's what is usually called 'planning' :-)<br />
[15:02:17] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: You are getting organized again! ;-)<br />
[15:02:39] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: I wish I'd be half as organized as you are! Maybe I'd get something done then.<br />
[15:02:44] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> scanline: how many developers have your pretty themes gotten you, btw? :-)<br />
[15:02:53] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> plfiorini: do you think you'll be able to look into the python stuff in the near future ?<br />
[15:03:22] &lt;<font color="slategray">plfiorini</font>&gt; <plfiorini> stefan: no i don't - i'm too busy<br />
[15:03:26] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> njs`: hard to tell.. I actually don't know how most of the people that contribute to picogui heard about it<br />
[15:03:28] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> ok<br />
[15:03:42] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> sdt: what about you ?<br />
[15:03:45] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: and you ?<br />
[15:03:46] &lt;<font color="slategray">plfiorini</font>&gt; <plfiorini> stefan: i am sorry :(<br />
[15:03:46] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> :-)<br />
[15:03:55] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: I have time on my hands right now.<br />
[15:04:07] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: ok. Any plans ?<br />
[15:04:07] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Dunno for how long, but I got some now.<br />
[15:04:21] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: I'd like to find those redrawing bugs.<br />
[15:04:24] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: be careful how you phrase that, or you'll be getting my bug list. :-)<br />
[15:04:37] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: ... which is a very depressing job:-(<br />
[15:04:47] <i> * <font color="purple">sdt</font> looks up </i><br />
[15:05:03] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Then I urgently need to redo Babylon/bidir stuff in the TextBuffer.<br />
[15:05:05] <i> * <font color="purple">sdt</font> is busy till end of april </i><br />
[15:05:17] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> and then around end of may (wedding....)<br />
[15:05:24] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> sdt: what about the summer ?<br />
[15:05:37] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> sdt: Is it you getting married?<br />
[15:05:39] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> in the summer I should have more time. I'll be working<br />
[15:05:41] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> hunger: yes<br />
[15:05:47] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> sdt: Congratulations!<br />
[15:05:50] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> thanks :)<br />
[15:05:55] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> sdt: congrats<br />
[15:05:55] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> sdt: define 'should' :-)<br />
[15:06:30] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> stefan: well, I'm hoping to. but you never know what might come up.<br />
[15:06:42] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> sdt: indeed<br />
[15:06:42] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> I'll certainly have much more time than I do now :)<br />
[15:07:06] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> sdt: well, that doesn't mean much, at least not to us outsiders :-)<br />
[15:07:50] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> heh. well, right now I probably shouldn't even be having this conversation<br />
[15:10:31] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> sdt: hypothetically, if you have more time to spend on Fresco, which part of Fresco gets the attention?<br />
[15:10:35] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: do you want to create a task for the Path stuff ?<br />
[15:10:39] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: ok<br />
[15:11:15] &lt;<font color="indigo">chrisime_</font>&gt; <chrisime_> hunger, isn't there a v0.5 of synopsis available?<br />
[15:11:28] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> chrisime_: Ask stefan, I don't know.<br />
[15:11:30] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> chrisime_: not yet. It's planned. <br />
[15:11:46] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> chrisime_: it isn't missing much, just some cleanup and documentation.<br />
[15:12:13] &lt;<font color="indigo">chrisime_</font>&gt; <chrisime_> stefan, i read the docu<br />
[15:12:20] &lt;<font color="indigo">chrisime_</font>&gt; <chrisime_> there's so much to configure<br />
[15:12:24] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: should I just adopt <a href="http://issues.fresco.org/task61">task61</a>?<br />
[15:12:25] &lt;<font color="indigo">chrisime_</font>&gt; <chrisime_> where should i start now ;)<br />
[15:12:48] <i> * <font color="indigo">chrisime_</font> wants to get rid of doxygen </i><br />
[15:13:27] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> nicholas: right now, I think I'd like to work on the coordinate stuff<br />
[15:13:34] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> because it's a little embarrassing.<br />
[15:13:35] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> sdt: yay! :-)<br />
[15:14:00] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> and I don't think I know enough fresco to do much more at this moment :)<br />
[15:16:45] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> ok, so I guess that covers M3 and part of M4!<br />
[15:16:56] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: no, I'd suggest a new one.<br />
[15:17:06] <i> * <font color="blue">nicholas</font> hears the drum roll. </i><br />
[15:17:23] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: yeah.<br />
[15:17:45] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: then which is more important? the new one or <a href="http://issues.fresco.org/task61">task61</a>?<br />
[15:17:55] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: I'll try to get sxr up and running, try to generate tutorial pdfs on purcel<br />
[15:17:58] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: the new one<br />
[15:18:31] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: I only added <a href="http://issues.fresco.org/task61">task61</a> to get to the OpenLook style. But I could do that with a better path API, too.<br />
[15:19:08] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: ok, it's <a href="http://issues.fresco.org/task139">task139</a><br />
[15:19:26] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: and I'd like to get hte daVinci stuff a *bit* usable, for example make objects selectable (and manipulatable), and save and load the stuff into svg.<br />
[15:19:45] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: fine. I'll add it to M3<br />
[15:22:11] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> ok. Is there a task for the coordinate system stuff?<br />
[15:24:06] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: well, that should be a bug first, no ?<br />
[15:24:16] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hehehe :)<br />
[15:24:19] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: if you say so.<br />
[15:25:07] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: I'm serious: a task is good if there is some project to track. But this is a bug, i.e. there isn't much to be done, beside finding the spot where the wrong computation is done.<br />
[15:25:32] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: hm? no, you have to change every instance of a coordinate in the widgetkit!<br />
[15:25:42] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: well, there is: once the bug is fixed, all the code that hardcodes sizes needs to be adjusted.<br />
[15:25:46] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: yeah<br />
[15:26:14] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: actually, I should've realized that there already is such a task: <a href="http://issues.fresco.org/task138">task138</a>.<br />
[15:26:30] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: of course, we can still argue that it should've been a bug. :-)<br />
[15:26:54] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> sdt: do you know (by chance) anything about posix rwlocks ?<br />
[15:27:00] &lt;<font color="purple">sdt</font>&gt; <sdt> stefan: sorry, no<br />
[15:27:40] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> I wrote a test but that behaves wrong, so I'm wondering whether linux' implementation is buggy...<br />
[15:30:38] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: are we done with the first item on the agenda?<br />
[15:31:27] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: looks so, yes.<br />
[15:31:33] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: what's left?<br />
[15:31:46] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: just my Q&A period?<br />
[15:32:00] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: heh<br />
[15:32:29] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: well, do you want to talk about 'quo vadis' ?<br />
[15:33:07] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> ... quo vadis?<br />
[15:33:31] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> "whither are you going?"<br />
[15:33:32] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> sure.<br />
[15:33:41] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: I'd like to see how the path stuff comes along. It may shift the way we look at fresco quite a bit. Oh, and I'd like to look into OpenSceneGraph. They do quite advanced stuff, and it would be interesting just to ponder about how to use one within the other.<br />
[15:34:05] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: Yes indeed. The scene graph core, from Fresco, looks very nice for what Fresco was--an X toolkit.<br />
[15:34:16] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: read: the 'encapsulate the traversal' stuff...<br />
[15:34:47] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: but I'm worried. Things like our decorators seem like really fat ways to do what should just be a call to the drawingkit->set_whatever function.<br />
[15:35:04] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: agreed<br />
[15:35:28] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: how should they "just be a call to the drawingkit->set_whatever function"?  they're different sorts of things.<br />
[15:35:30] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: And I'm worried that the decorators aren't tied closely enough to the rendering backend any more, and that the design was never intended to support this.<br />
[15:35:34] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: well, or use at postscript (NeWS): it's basically a programming language.<br />
[15:35:44] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: a decorator is declarative, calling a function is imperative.<br />
[15:35:51] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: not really. An RGBDecorator just calls drawing->rgb(). <br />
[15:36:03] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: so I'd like to see whether the Path API will evolve into something like a tiny embedded programming languages (for a very constrained domain, I admit).<br />
[15:36:04] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: and a lot of extra fluff at the cost of code size performance and bugs.<br />
[15:36:24] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: yeah, we all agree on that.<br />
[15:36:29] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: well, but you can't stick a call to drawing->rbg() in the scene graph as is, because a call to drawing->rgb() is not an object!<br />
[15:36:51] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: exactly my point. It seems that the scene graph idea is busted, at some level.<br />
[15:36:52] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: so I don't exactly follow what you think is wrong<br />
[15:36:59] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: ???<br />
[15:37:08] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: you heard me correctly.<br />
[15:37:19] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: no, I didn't, unless what you're saying makes no sense :-)<br />
[15:37:42] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: what's wrong with the scene graph idea?<br />
[15:37:49] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: well, we could just define our own language for everything. OpenGL is going down that path. PostScript is already there. But do we really want to do another one? What specifications are we even looking for? Maybe we should say that Fresco is like TeX with GUI components?<br />
[15:38:14] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> TeX is a pretty sucky language, as languages go :-)<br />
[15:38:27] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: the Graphics in the scene graph know too little about the content they're charged with rendering, and too little about the medium they're rendering to.<br />
[15:38:32] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> njs: It's not really meant to be a programming language.<br />
[15:38:35] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: well, I wouldn't dare keep the syntax. :)<br />
[15:38:43] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> hunger: I understand.  It<br />
[15:38:54] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> 's still a pretty sucky language<br />
[15:38:58] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: yes. Well, I guess it's a matter of granularity / domain.<br />
[15:39:22] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: defining a highly specialized language for a very well defined (small) domain is fine.<br />
[15:39:25] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: in what sense?  can you explain what more they should know, and how this is connected to wanting procedures to be data?<br />
[15:40:07] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: can we just repair the problem by allowing the graphics to query the traversal/drawingkit for more information about the rendering device? Allow our WYSIWYG design to be default, but allow "fancy" activities where warrented?<br />
[15:40:33] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: scanline said it best: "fresco separates device from look rather than separating presentation from content"<br />
[15:40:57] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> drawing probably does need more information about the device being rendered too -- you need "level of detail" info, for one thing, when doing curves.  And damage needs to care about resolution too.<br />
[15:41:03] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I see the scenegraph as a description of what is on the screen.<br />
[15:41:07] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: if the content is an email compose window, it should look like one on a desktop or on a PDA.<br />
[15:41:10] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: I think the issue is not imperative vs. functional but instead of fine-grained scene graph nodes should be, or in general, what the object model for sg nodes is. Is the scene graph to be accessed concurrently ? Is it to be location transparent ?<br />
[15:41:11] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> ooh, people are quoting me :)<br />
[15:41:12] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: indeed, that it is.<br />
[15:41:31] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: what scanline says is silly, though.  those are orthogonal domains.<br />
[15:41:36] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> scanline: indeed. it's an excellent quote. :)<br />
[15:41:39] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: That's below the content area anyway.<br />
[15:41:46] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: no, I'm strictly against such an approach. Querying the renderer for specifics breaks the encapsulation.<br />
[15:41:56] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: or else we are back in X<br />
[15:42:01] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: why is that encapsulation manditory?<br />
[15:42:17] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: well.<br />
[15:42:31] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: I don't understand that quote (from scanline)<br />
[15:43:03] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: well, it's not mandatory, but I think the current culture around X just proves what's wrong:<br />
[15:43:04] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: separating presentation from content is a nice thing; I think core Fresco would be an excellent thing to build such a layer on :-)<br />
[15:43:21] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: you hand over responsibility to clients to use the insight they get by querying the renderer.<br />
[15:43:25] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I'd prefer to add some layer above the scenegraph then compromising the encapsulation.<br />
[15:43:35] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: we shouldn't do that, that knowledge is best kept inside the server.<br />
[15:43:56] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: so is the server responsible for graphical layout decisions?<br />
[15:44:16] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: beside, you have to define what 'content' mean. The 'content' of one domain could well be the 'look' of another.<br />
[15:44:54] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: like what ? as much as 'device space' is involved, yes, of course.<br />
[15:45:10] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`, hunger: well, yes. But then we might have to worry about the toolkit-on-X problem. Your layer isn't much use if some people bypass it.<br />
[15:45:19] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> scanline: and people are attacking your quote, too.  you're famous! :-)<br />
[15:45:23] &lt;<font color="red">scanline</font>&gt; <scanline> wow :)<br />
[15:45:36] <i> * <font color="green">stefan</font> grins </i><br />
[15:45:38] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: well, for a PDF I understand how the look is the content. That's what Fresco, today, allows for.<br />
[15:45:48] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: Graphics designers will love it.<br />
[15:45:50] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: well, we have that hole already, in that someone can always use the ToolKit to create their own widgets.<br />
[15:46:08] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: or clientside Graphics.<br />
[15:46:17] <font color="darkcyan">LordVan</font> changes name to <font color="darkcyan">LV|off</font><br />
[15:46:17] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: should we support client side Graphics?<br />
[15:46:21] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: but having a safety valve of that sort is probably important, even as we try to minimize the need for it.<br />
[15:46:25] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> exactly. It's a matter of choosing the right abstraction. Aka, whether to use WidgetKit or TasketKit (say)<br />
[15:46:29] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: you know my opinion on that :-)<br />
[15:46:56] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: I don't think we should like them, but I can still imagine applications that can't live without them.<br />
[15:48:17] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: so if we keep the Graphics separate from the rendering backend, through a generic interface... should we provide generic Models that our client must use to interface with them?<br />
[15:48:26] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Agreed. They'll generate something like what we have describing our widgets with htose building blocks.<br />
[15:48:26] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: you can<br />
[15:48:38] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> 't get reasonable performance with client-side graphics.  I just don't see it.<br />
[15:48:52] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: for example, in Java, the JTable requires that the client provide a TableModel for the JTable to use.<br />
[15:49:00] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: We should have something to allow for changing kits (especially widgetkit) at runtime above that,<br />
[15:49:00] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: why do you need generic models to interface with graphics ? <br />
[15:49:19] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: so that the Graphics know what content they're responsible for laying out, so that they can do so intelligently.<br />
[15:49:51] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: can't that be covered with composition ?<br />
[15:50:00] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: (as a paradigm, I mean)<br />
[15:50:01] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: ok, so a SwitcherKit that maintains what widgets were constructed, and is prepared to switch to a different kit at any time?<br />
[15:50:16] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: ???<br />
[15:50:18] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: that's an interesting statement, unless I forget what composition is. How so?<br />
[15:50:36] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: well, isn't that just our mantra ?<br />
[15:50:38] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I'd prefer to have some support for that inside the server. Dunno how a Kit is supposed to figure out how to change other kits.<br />
[15:50:53] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: I thought "lightweight decorators allow for code reuse" was our mantra. :)<br />
[15:51:06] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: ok.<br />
[15:51:28] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: individual graphics are primitive, but you get complexity by building the SG in specific ways that reflect the state of your application.<br />
[15:51:30] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: PicoGUI uses a "widgetGraph"... soemthing like that.<br />
[15:51:38] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: Right. Like that.<br />
[15:52:22] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: So far I'd prefer to concentrate on making the scenegraph work.<br />
[15:53:31] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: So the client makes all decisions for how its GUI is composed.<br />
[15:53:52] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: not all, but the part that reflects the application's state.<br />
[15:54:09] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: (the rest is configurable and only reflects the currently selected 'style'<br />
[15:54:11] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> )<br />
[15:54:11] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I was thinking wether it would be possible to shortcuircit CORBA using the data from the GraphicDictionary for serverside graphics. That could reduce the overhead for the decorators quite a bit that seems to be worrying you.<br />
[15:54:35] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: I've lost sight of what the gain of it is.<br />
[15:54:36] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: how that ?<br />
[15:54:40] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> is it the traversal cost that worries you about decorators?  it's really not that high, I think.<br />
[15:54:42] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Wasn't it supposed to be extended code reuse?<br />
[15:54:47] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> and how big is Fresco now?<br />
[15:54:57] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: the traversal still traverses Graphic_ptrs, not ServantImpls...<br />
[15:55:00] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> and wasn't more code reuse supposed to reduce bugs over all?<br />
[15:55:15] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> and why are we spending so much time tracking down our bugs?<br />
[15:55:30] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Wasn't CORBA supposed to save us from creating a new client binding for every language we'd like to support?<br />
[15:55:36] <i> * <font color="green">stefan</font> is *very* curious to try fresco with the new thread library (glibc 2.3), and measure performance </i><br />
[15:55:42] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Basically a "shadowgraph" using GraphicImpl* instead of the Graphic_ptr (or falls back to the 'normal SG" if the graphic is remote).<br />
[15:55:51] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> How come we only support C++, have broken python support and maybe Java?<br />
[15:55:53] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: umm, the fact that we have bugs does not prove that we have a bad architecture.  _everyone_ spends time tracking down bugs.<br />
[15:56:02] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: sounds horribly memory hungry<br />
[15:56:24] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: heh, you sound so negative...:-)<br />
[15:56:29] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: It probably is. But then I see memory as less a problem then speed right now.<br />
[15:56:40] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: I'm trying to thwack against the tree *really hard* and see what falls out. :-)<br />
[15:56:54] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: in Fresco's case, I get the impression that for a long time, nobody ever bothered with bugs... the bugs we fix now have been accumulating for literally years :-)<br />
[15:56:55] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: I don't believe your GraphicDictionary is a solution for anything than debugging<br />
[15:57:06] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Anyway: I just love the idea of decorators.<br />
[15:57:12] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: that's a good point. I'll take it. :)<br />
[15:57:33] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: But would you object to more complicated Graphics that didn't use Decorators?<br />
[15:57:52] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: We'll see. It's a bit of information, nothing more, nothing less. I'm just trying to put it to good use.<br />
[15:57:54] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: I'm not going to argue with the CORBA points; I'm personally pretty convinced that CORBA needs to go altogether :-).  But not ready to argue it in this channel yet.<br />
[15:58:01] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: honestly, I love to shake the tree with you. But I still have some ideas of what is fundamentally right and what isn't :-))<br />
[15:58:14] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Yes.<br />
[15:58:35] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: well, let's do it now. :)<br />
[15:58:38] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: The idea of having simple things and building more complex graphics out of those is very important to me.<br />
[15:58:53] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> What do we want in a communications protocol? Asynchronous communication? Bindings that use C++ STL?<br />
[15:59:05] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: hm.<br />
[15:59:16] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: I agree, that's what OO programming is about. That's why we have libraries.<br />
[15:59:39] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: I'm not sure, though I've been putting a fair amount of thought into it.<br />
[15:59:52] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Many people seem to think OO is about inheriting stuff to make even more complex stuff:-)<br />
[15:59:53] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: but there's something plain wierd about the Fresco SG. I'm not willing to make a final judgement or anything.<br />
[16:01:02] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: I mean, if we were to design a comm protocol from scratch today, how many features would it share with CORBA? How many of them would be things that omniORB doesn't offer us?<br />
[16:01:20] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: I'm just concerned that we've got a bad fit already, as of today.<br />
[16:01:20] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I'm not trying to stop you. Please keep arguing, that's a very valuable contribution to fresco IMHO.<br />
[16:01:30] <font color="teal">icebird</font> has joined #fresco<br />
[16:01:41] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: well, let's suppose that I'm playing the devil's advocate. :)<br />
[16:02:07] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: and nicholas_evil has decided that the SG is a lousy was of describing object relationships.<br />
[16:02:37] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: What is a better way according to nicholas_evil then?<br />
[16:02:50] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas: eh, "design a comm protocol from scratch today" is not the question, so much as "design a comm protocol that's a good fit to our problem domain".  If you want a modern CORBA, use ICE :-)  But I don't think we want a modern CORBA, exactly.<br />
[16:02:51] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Having komplex graphics?<br />
[16:02:59] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: because the colour that I want the next object to be drawn in is a property of that object.<br />
[16:03:17] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: not a wrapper around it.<br />
[16:03:25] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> oops, there's a talk now I should go to<br />
[16:03:30] <font color="green">nicholas_devil</font> has joined #fresco<br />
[16:03:34] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> back later<br />
[16:03:35] &lt;<font color="green">nicholas_devil</font>&gt; <nicholas_devil> someone called me ?<br />
[16:03:40] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: oh. bye.<br />
[16:03:40] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: With that argumentation we end up with something like QT pretty fast.<br />
[16:03:42] <font color="green">nicholas_devil</font> has quit (Client Quit)<br />
[16:03:55] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> nicholas_devil: so you'll be handling the BSD port?<br />
[16:04:00] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: what's wrong with that? Qt is quite popular.<br />
[16:04:12] <i> * <font color="blue">nicholas</font> notes that nicholas_devil isn't me. </i><br />
[16:04:23] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> vintage fresco is closer to what nicholas is arguing for than modern fresco, incidentally.<br />
[16:04:24] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I don't want to redo something that's allready there.<br />
[16:04:27] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: did you have a look into ice ?<br />
[16:04:52] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> stefan: yes, I can tell you all about it.  It's GPL, though, so probably not useful to us directly.<br />
[16:04:55] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: And the decorator concept is pretty consistent IMHO.<br />
[16:05:03] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> njs`: vintage fresco seems a better fit for the Fresco design. In fact, sometimes I wish Java was closer to vintage Fresco.<br />
[16:05:15] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I admit that it is slower then just having a call to the DK.<br />
[16:05:16] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> njs`: I noted that Michi Henning is working on it.<br />
[16:05:22] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: you mean that we apply it consistently throughout our code?<br />
[16:05:30] &lt;<font color="maroon">njs`</font>&gt; <njs`> stefan: yes, it's quite nice, for what it is.<br />
[16:05:44] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: That and it is the one way to change a color.<br />
[16:06:13] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: It's not button->foreground(), label->color(), ...<br />
[16:06:39] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: that would make much cleaner looking C++ code.<br />
[16:07:31] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: and either way, the core is just a Color object, but why the entirety of wrapping the Color object in a Graphic?<br />
[16:07:33] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Maybe. But that's not what I am after.<br />
[16:08:19] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: further, what about Graphics that have complex modifications? You don't want to apply a simple rotation to a spreadsheet (a table with headings) because you wouldn't want the text to get rotated.<br />
[16:08:50] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: You need to have one object type to make C++ happy.<br />
[16:09:05] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: but maybe that's just me being wrong-headed; after all, rotating the view and rotating the content are entirely different. (For no good reason I can find.)<br />
[16:09:33] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: At the SG-level I'm mostly concerned that things are possible, not that it's trivial for a programmer to do whatever he wants to do.<br />
[16:10:16] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: well, right now it's possible for any Graphic to do anything that the DrawingKit interface allows. Remember that any Graphic can reset the transformation and do whatever it likes.<br />
[16:10:36] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: That's not good, agreed.<br />
[16:10:38] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: then there's the question of what a well-behaved Fresco Graphic should be doing, which deserves documentation.<br />
[16:11:03] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Agred again. But that won't change with making graphics heavier, will it?<br />
[16:11:43] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: But should it be disallowed? Maybe we should force clipping to the extent.  But some Graphics deserve changing the transformation in strange ways before they pass it to their clients. A 90-degree rotated table was my first example; it should un-rotate the text labels before traversing them.<br />
[16:11:56] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: no it won't.<br />
[16:12:30] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: although, finding a way to force clipping to the extent such that the Graphic can't reset it would involve a chunk more complexity on the part of the DrawingKit.<br />
[16:12:39] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Maybe the user wants the text rotated too? You cannot just automate this anyway.<br />
[16:12:52] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: user? we're talking about the developer.<br />
[16:12:58] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: users don't create Graphics.<br />
[16:13:25] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Well, the developer will need to handle both cases if he wants his users to be happy.<br />
[16:14:35] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: As long as both is possible I'm happy.<br />
[16:14:50] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: What we need to talk about is the DrawingKit's interface.<br />
[16:15:13] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: well. At the moment, we'd need to: 1. create the text labels. 2. wrap them in an un-rotating wrapper. 3. put those wrappers in the table.<br />
[16:15:17] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Not only to make clipping possible but also to allow for caching areas.<br />
[16:15:27] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: doing it the other way, where text gets rotated, just leave out step two.<br />
[16:15:41] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: well, nobody knows how areas will be cached.<br />
[16:15:50] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: actually, Fresco is already very good at that.<br />
[16:15:55] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: It is?<br />
[16:16:17] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: It gets considerably slower the more windows you open.<br />
[16:16:21] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: iff you assume that the output device can save a rectangular area of pixel-space, yes.<br />
[16:17:09] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: hopefully we aren't drawtraversing unmapped windows... ;-)<br />
[16:17:38] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: How much work is it to generate a table with rotated text lables in QT or GTK?<br />
[16:17:49] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I doubt that it is much less...<br />
[16:18:23] <i> * <font color="green">stefan</font> notes that another thing to work on is a DamageManager. Something to port over from Fresco98, actually. </i><br />
[16:18:47] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: well it makes more sense to most programmers to say, "create me the table, now setDoRotateContents(true) (or false)" than it does to have all this wrapper stuff.<br />
[16:19:05] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: even if we grant that Fresco can do everything GTK, Qt and Java can do<br />
[16:19:13] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: we still have a *terrible* interface!<br />
[16:19:34] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Agreed again. But I don't hink it's terrible because of the idea of decorators.<br />
[16:19:56] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: then why is it?<br />
[16:20:21] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I keep looking for the kits to generate the graphics I need... but that's just an implementation detail.<br />
[16:20:30] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: what do you find 'terrible' ? The style ?<br />
[16:20:59] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: As I see it we are working to get a flexible way to describe generic things.<br />
[16:21:23] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: basically, yes. I find it horribly counter-intuitive to create my "x" then say, now create a colouring-decorator and putting my "x" in the constructor. All I really wanted was x->set_color(rgb);<br />
[16:21:34] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: That's fairly low-level or it wouldn't be as generic. We need some layer above that.<br />
[16:22:00] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: hmm, that's because you are trained that way.<br />
[16:22:05] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: We used to have "Moscow" for all that high-level stuff.<br />
[16:22:14] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: so it's possible-but-ugly without this layer, and nicer with another layer? Too bad that higher layer won't be available in every language like CORBA is.<br />
[16:22:26] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Why not?<br />
[16:22:43] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Write a "tablekit" that does all the low-level magic for you.<br />
[16:22:55] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: because I thought it was going to be a client-side library, but I guess I was wrong. :)<br />
[16:23:01] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: so indeed I am.<br />
[16:23:27] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: You are not using the ToolKit to draw your buttoms either, are you?<br />
[16:23:34] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: but isn't that the way the language designers intended?<br />
[16:23:49] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: no.<br />
[16:23:52] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: I see.<br />
[16:24:16] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: can't really argue there.<br />
[16:24:31] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: except that CORBA/C++ not using the STL is, uh, unfortunate.<br />
[16:24:42] <font color="slategray">plfiorini</font> changes name to <font color="slategray">pl_afk</font><br />
[16:24:44] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: My concern is making things possible now. That's bound to be rather low-level stuff.<br />
[16:24:49] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I fully agree.<br />
[16:25:15] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: But I don't see anything else we could use without sacrifycing something.<br />
[16:26:22] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: when I look at a refmanual, I see which method call takes what, and that tells me what I need to create first. It shows me how to build my object. (Ie., JFrame.setJMenuBar takes... a JMenuBar! Which has a method that takes a JMenu! Then a JMenuItem! and that takes a simple String and an ActionListener. Well, I can see what's going on from there. But with Fresco? Realize that we've basically destroyed types<br />
[16:26:26] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> uld get lost.)<br />
[16:26:30] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: sorry, what language are you talking about ?<br />
[16:26:37] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: Java.<br />
[16:26:52] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: oh<br />
[16:27:08] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: I was talking about building the scene graph using decoration<br />
[16:27:21] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: mmhmm.<br />
[16:27:30] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: there you basically need to understand the kit interface<br />
[16:28:25] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Well, that's the idea, isen't it? A Decorator is pretty generic and can go around anything.<br />
[16:28:32] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: and I could well see a method widgetKit::create_label(const Unistring &, const Color &) if that's desired. That d'oesn't prevent it being implemented with decorators.<br />
[16:28:42] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I see that as a advantage (consistency).<br />
[16:29:06] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: no it doesn't. Maybe we should think about that, improving our interfaces so that they're more developer-friendly.<br />
[16:29:24] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: what they do under the hood doesn't matter as long as it works. And Decorators are good, aren't they?<br />
[16:29:46] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: That's a higher-level issue again, isen't it?<br />
[16:29:56] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: It's an important issue.<br />
[16:30:09] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: I agree in principle.<br />
[16:30:37] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: It's an very important issue once we have the functionality to actually support some application.<br />
[16:31:14] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Till then it's just a convinience thing for our demos:-)<br />
[16:31:20] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: We have most of the functionality. What are we missing? curves? font selection? gradients? Anything an application author can't live without?<br />
[16:31:39] &lt;<font color="indigo">chrisime_</font>&gt; <chrisime_> stefan, got a short question<br />
[16:31:58] &lt;<font color="indigo">chrisime_</font>&gt; <chrisime_> stefan, i got synopsis running, it works but in the end there's an error<br />
[16:32:00] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: We have no menus yet, so we don't need to make those easy to use yet.<br />
[16:32:26] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: fonts are a big issue too, of course. Without those we can't do too much.<br />
[16:32:33] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: well, by your principle, we just need to implement the DesktopKit---transient was it?---and call menus done.<br />
[16:32:55] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Basically yes:-)<br />
[16:33:09] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: and how do you feel about implementing it? :-)<br />
[16:33:19] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: We should start at some conviniece things at that point though.<br />
[16:33:37] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> nicholas: Not too well, because I'm a clueless idiot.<br />
[16:33:49] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> hunger: please. So am I. :-)<br />
[16:34:01] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> mm, DesktopKit::pulldown I think<br />
[16:34:29] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> What's funny is that there's already code there. It looks complete too.<br />
[16:34:32] <font color="slategray">pl_afk</font> changes name to <font color="slategray">plfiorini</font><br />
[16:35:05] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> Indeed, there's an entire Pulldown.cc.<br />
[16:35:27] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> chrisime_: ?<br />
[16:36:22] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: well, the point about pulldowns is (as I have repeatedly pointed out) that there is no working focus management<br />
[16:36:59] &lt;<font color="blue">nicholas</font>&gt; <nicholas> stefan: oh right. Hm :(<br />
[16:37:05] <i> * <font color="blue">nicholas</font> has dinner now, actually. </i><br />
[16:37:31] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> nicholas: ok, let's call it an end and continue this another time. It's starting to get a bit out of hand anyways<br />
[16:37:52] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Something else: Have you thought about how we can "stack" contorllers?<br />
[16:38:16] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Like "raise window when titlebar is clicked, move it when dragged"?<br />
[16:38:55] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: what do you mean by 'stack' ? As in 'decorate' ?<br />
[16:39:18] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: I'd prefer the decorator approach.<br />
[16:39:32] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: I don't knwo wether it will work out though,.<br />
[16:39:59] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: How can we have one area that reacts to clicks and draggs?<br />
[16:40:31] <font color="blue">phoen][x</font> has joined #fresco<br />
[16:40:38] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Who is respnsible to figure out wether a event is a drag or a click?<br />
[16:40:48] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: that's quite hard. You need to *interpret* events, or gestures more generally.<br />
[16:41:01] <i> * <font color="blue">phoen][x</font> says aloha </i><br />
[16:41:06] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: That's why I'm asking you:-)<br />
[16:41:09] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> phoen][x: Hi!<br />
[16:41:26] &lt;<font color="blue">phoen][x</font>&gt; <phoen][x> heyas hunger and everyone else<br />
[16:41:55] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: as I said, event handling and focus management are two issues that are very hard to get right. I'd like to work on that, but this is a complex issue and it will take time.<br />
[16:42:04] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Having a drag-click controller would be very ugly IMHO. But I couldn't think of an other way to do it.<br />
[16:42:28] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: well, chain-of-responsability comes to mind.<br />
[16:42:44] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Except having controllers in a "controllerchain" talk to each other.<br />
[16:42:57] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: but as this is about gestures ('composite events'), you can't pass individual events, but need a full event sequence.<br />
[16:43:05] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: 'talk to each other' ?<br />
[16:43:15] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: no, just pass an even sequence down if they can't handle it.<br />
[16:43:58] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Like the first controller (buttom) sees a move and passes the complete event that it has seen so far on to the dragger?<br />
[16:45:08] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: yes, if it is a 'move' and the button can't handle a 'move'.<br />
[16:45:19] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: s/complete event/gesture/<br />
[16:45:34] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: (just to stick to terminology :-)<br />
[16:45:43] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: Sorry.<br />
[16:46:16] &lt;<font color="green">stefan</font>&gt; <stefan> hunger: well, 'gesture' is what I used for that. I'd like to keep that, not because it's the best term, but because it's more precise than 'event' or 'event sequence'.<br />
[16:47:46] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> stefan: That's fine with me.<br />
[16:50:10] <i> * <font color="blue">nicholas</font> has returned </i><br />

[16:51:51] &lt;<font color="brown">hunger</font>&gt; <hunger> Aehm... maybe...<br />
